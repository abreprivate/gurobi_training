To do this, we'll take the perspective of a person who is selling iron and calcium pills to the dieter. The pill-seller must decide how much to charge per pill. Each pill contains one unit of its respective nutrient. And, the pills must be priced competitively with respect to the five food types available to the dieter.\n",

We enforce fair pricing by writing a structural constraint for each of the 5 food types. For example, food type 3 is equivalent to 3 iron pills and 2 calcium pills, and is priced at 31 per ounce, so $3 \\pi_i + 2 \\pi_c \\le 31$."
