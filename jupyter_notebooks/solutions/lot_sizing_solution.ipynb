    "Consider a discrete-time, finite-horizon inventory control problem where you must satisfy a given demand. $d_t$ for each week $t$. This demand can be satisfied by production in any week $t' \\le t$. For each week, there is a per unit production cost, a per unit inventory holding cost, and a setup cost. The setup cost is a fixed cost incurred if any production occurs during the week. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the setup cost is paid at most once each week, regardless of whether you produce 1 unit or 1000, you have an incentive to potentially produce enough during a week to cover the demand for multiple weeks. But, producing in excess of the week's demand requires you to hold inventory. This tradeoff between setup and holding costs can be managed through optimization."
