    "\n",
    "While this row-wise view is frequently the most intuitive view of the model, there are some cases in which it is difficult to describe the set of variables corresponding to a constraint. In these cases it may actually be easier to focus on a single variable or column, and ask what constraints that variable participates in. That is, we may wish to think about what a specific column in the constraint matrix looks like.\n",

    "Both the row-wise and column-wise approaches can lead us to a correct representation of the model, there are reasons to prefer one over the other depending on the context. Generally speaking, we will prefer the column-wise perspective when each variable appears in a fixed number of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the shortest path formulation above, each variable indicates whether we traverse a particular arc, and each constraint enforces a conservation of flow for a particular city. Consider one of these constraints, say the one corresponding to Chicago. Each of the rows in the arc DataFrame above corresponds to a decision variable. We can certainly look up the arcs that are incident to Chicago -- there is an inbound arc from Honolulu and two outbound arcs to Boston and New York -- and write down a constraint that says that we only traverse an outbound arc if we traversed an inbound arc. We could repeat this arc lookup for each city to build the full model, with each lookup returning a different subset of arcs depending on the city.\n",

    "Now consider one of the variables in the model, say the one corresponding to the arc from Los Angeles to New York. Determining which constraints this variable participates in requires no lookup. It participates in the constraint for Los Angeles and the constraint for New York. In fact, every variable in the model participates in exactly two constraints-- one for the source and one for the destination city. If we follow the convention that flow in to a city is positive and flow out is negative, each column in the constraint matrix has exactly two non-zero entries, a 1 for the destination city and a -1 for the source city. That each column has a very easily-defined structure is an indication that the model is amenable to a column-wise approach."
