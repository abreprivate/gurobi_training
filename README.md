# gurobi_training

#### Course Description
***
This repository includes slides and Jupyter Notebooks for learning how to build and solve math programming models with Gurobi.  
  
The gurobitraining slides are an introduction to using Gurobi and include example models and exercises 
to illustrate the process of adding decision variables, building linear expressions, and optimizing for a particular objective function. 
There are two Jupyter Notebooks for every example model in the slides, one that is a completed key and one with instructions to fill in missing pieces of code.  
  
The integer_programming and quadratic slides illustrate more advanced concepts such as integer programming and column-based and quadratic modelling.

#### Installation  
***
This course requires the use of [Gurobi](gurobi.com) optimization software and the [Anaconda](anaconda.com) Python distribution platform.  
  
Visit the [Gurobi Downloads and License Center](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) to acquire a license and download the latest version of Gurobi Optimizer. 
Once you have chosen the appropriate license, accept the End User License Agreement and follow the installation instructions in the README that corresponds to the most recent software version.  
For Windows and Mac users, simply download the appropriate distribution and double click the installer to be walked through the install process.
For Linux and AIX users, you will first need to choose an install location, then copy the Gurobi distribution to that location and extract the Gurobi files.
Finally, consult the Release Notes and the Gurobi Quick Start guide as linked in the current README to get started with Gurobi on your device.  
  
You will need the Jupyter Notebook application from Anaconda to read and edit the example code exercises once you the clone the repository to your computer.
Download the individual edition of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) using the installers linked at the bottom of the page.
Once running the installer, confirm installation and agree to the license to finish adding the program to your computer.
